# Data Structures and Algorithsm in Python
## Purpose
This repository is a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for to use when learning data structures and algorithms.
The code is not meant to be used in production, but rather as a reference for learning and having fun.
